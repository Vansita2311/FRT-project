"One-Health"-It is a website of a hospital where people can book their appointment with a doctor, consult a specialist doctor for their health issues and get medication which makes it easier for the patient to diagnose a disease/problem.I used azure static web app services for deploying this website. We can know about the hospital, Doctors and facilities that are provided in this hospital. Patients can solve their queries related to health issues and covid-19 by connecting with a chat-bot and get information about any health related queries or doubts because in this pandemic era, everyone is at a high risk of catching Covid-19. This chat-bot made by using azure bot serveices and qna maker.
